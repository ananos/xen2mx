In case of problem, make sure you read the README first :)
Please look at the online FAQ as well at
  http://open-mx.org/FAQ/


Bugs should be reported on http://open-mx.org
or sent to open-mx-devel@lists.gforge.inria.fr .
Questions may be asked there too.

When reporting a problem, make sure you include:
* the version number of Open-MX
  (or the SVN revision if you checkouted the SVN repository)
* a description of the ethernet interfaces that you are trying
  to use, with the whole outputs (as root) of:
  + lspci
  + lsmod
  + dmesg
  + ifconfig -a
  + ethtool -c <iface>
* a description of your network topology:
  + how are the interfaces connected?
  + through what switch(es)? is the MTU set to 9000 there too?
* the whole output of the program if a program did not work
  as expected
* the whole output of configure, config.log and omx_check.h,
  and of the compilation if reporting a kernel build problem
